"""
OpenAI Agents instrumentation example using OpenInference with Gentrace.

This example demonstrates how to use OpenInference instrumentation with the OpenAI Agents
Python SDK (formerly known as Swarm). It shows:

1. Setting up OpenInference instrumentation for OpenAI Agents
2. Creating agents with specific capabilities and tools
3. Enabling agent handoffs for complex workflows
4. Automatic tracing of agent interactions, tool calls, and handoffs

The OpenInference instrumentation captures:
- Full agent conversations and responses
- Tool invocations and their results
- Agent handoffs and context transfers
- Model parameters and metadata

This provides comprehensive observability for agent-based applications.
